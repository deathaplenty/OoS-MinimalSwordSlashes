# Goriya Bros
## Movement

It seems to me that they choose to throw their boomerang based on RNG, but they move in such a way that they try to circle you counterclockwise, at least while you're in the middle of the room. Standing in the middle, they will continually circle, but never get close. While you can predict their movements this way, their sudden and unpredictable stops still make it hard to track them.


## Damage
It takes 4 bomb hits to kill Goriya Bros, but you have to deal all of those hits to one brother. Since we get the easy 2 hits on Blue, you should always aim for Blue with your subsequent bombs.

## Strategy

Given that you have 9 bombs, you have three bombs to use on the bros. You can always get a guaranteed two hits on the blue one at the start of the fight, leaving 2 bombs and 2 hits left.

If you can't kill them with three bombs, knowing their circling pattern allows you to safely go for punches. This is a lot slower than if you could get another 2 hits with bombs.
