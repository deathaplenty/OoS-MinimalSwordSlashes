# Minimal Sword Slashes Route
---
## Before Dungeon 1
The run starts typically. Skip through the text for the roadies as fast as possible, dance with Din, skip through Onox cutscene, and make your way to D0 for the L-1 Sword.

This is where the run diverges. After you get the sword, go up above D0 and slash the grass (our first sword slash), fall down the hole and collect 30 rupees. Use 20 of these rupees to buy bombs at the shop. Go to the Maku Tree and slash your sword to open the path (2nd slash). Use a bomb to wake the Maku Tree, saving a sword slash, and get the key to D1.

Before going to D1, we have some boring grinding and manipulations to do. First, go to the Know-it-all Birds hut, enter, exit and save. Now, for the boring part.

Perform Swordless Octo Farming manipulations until you kill thirty Octos, enough to spawn Maple. SOF works by making sure you get enough rupees to constantly buy more bombs to farm more, so don't worry about running out of bombs.
(Doing the manipulation each time gets you a surplus of rupees which aren't needed. Optimally, you would only manip the rupees you need, but the manip also sets the Octos up for easy bomb kills.)

After farming, it's time to perform the Fist Ring Manipulation. After you get the ring, make sure you appraise and equip it. You're now ready for D1. Buy more bombs if you'd like. It'd be better than punching Stalfos.

## Dungeon 1
Upon entering Dungeon 1, you are faced with two rooms with 4 stalfos in each. Kill the Stalfos with bombs/ Fist Ring

Use Fist Ring to flip the minecart switch. (This is why we get Fist Ring.)

Damage boosting in the trap room before Goriya brothers isn't recommended unless you use a bomb to grab the fairy toward the end, but it would probably be best to save all of your bombs for Goriya Bros.

After you get seed satchel, take the warp back to boss key. (Save and Quit warping will require you to clear a stalfos room again, so don't do that.) After you have boss key, save and quit warp to the dungeon entrance.

Protip: Keep an eye on your ember seed and bomb count. You'll need one or both of these items to continue after D1.

If you are low on bombs after getting the boss key, you will want to go buy bombs so that you can kill the D1 boss with them. Exit the dungeon, burn the bush with the old man underneath to get 100 rupees if you need them, and go buy bombs. You need at least 5 bombs to beat the D1 boss.

## To Subrosia, then D2
The most important thing to remember on your way to getting the Rod of Seasons is to have enough ember seeds and bombs to clear the grass blocking the portal, and at least 1 bomb to get to winter without having to get the boomerang. Other than that this part of the run is identical to Any%. If you need ember seeds on your entry to D2, there are two grass tiles in front of the entrance that are guaranteed ember seed drops.

## Dungeon 2
