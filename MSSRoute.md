# Minimal Sword Slashes Route

## Before Dungeon 1
The run starts typically. Skip through the text for the roadies as fast as possible, dance with Din, skip through Onox cutscene, and make your way to Hero's Cave for the L-1 Sword.

This is where the run diverges. After you get the sword, go up above Hero's Cave. If the Octroks are in a good position, you can spinslash, killing both Octos and cutting the grass; these are two less kills you need with bombs later. Otherwise just cut the grass and fall down the hole to collect 30 rupees. Use 20 of these rupees to buy bombs at the shop.

Before going to D1, we have some grinding and manipulations to do. First, go to the Know-it-all Birds hut, enter, exit and save. Now, for the boring part.

Perform [Swordless Octo Farming](https://github.com/deathaplenty/OoS-MinimalSwordSlashes/blob/master/Manipulations.md#swordless-octo-farming) manipulations until you kill thirty Octoroks, enough to spawn Maple. Perform the manip that gets rupees just enough time to have enough for more bombs. After that, it's quicker to do the rupeeless manip.

After farming, it's time to perform the [Fist Ring](https://github.com/deathaplenty/OoS-MinimalSwordSlashes/blob/master/Manipulations.md#fist-ring-manip) manipulation. After you get the ring, make sure you appraise and equip it.

Go to the Maku Tree and slash your sword to open the path. Use a bomb to wake the Maku Tree and get the key to Gnarled Root Dungeon. You're now ready for D1.

###### Protip
Be careful when mashing to skip text, you may accidentally swing your sword.

## D1: Gnarled Root Dungeon
Upon entering Dungeon 1, you are faced with two rooms with 4 stalfos in each. Kill the Stalfos with bombs/ Fist Ring

Use Fist Ring to flip the minecart switch. (This is why we get Fist Ring.)

Damage boosting in the trap room before Goriya brothers isn't recommended unless you use a bomb to grab the fairy toward the end, but it would probably be best to save as many bombs as possible for Goriya Brothers. You have to save 6 bombs (5 for Aquamentus, 1 for Winter Spirit), so you at most only have 3 or 4 bombs to use on them, unless you go grab more from somewhere, which is slow.

### Miniboss: Goriya Brothers
Take a look at this [document](https://github.com/deathaplenty/OoS-MinimalSwordSlashes/blob/master/Misc/GoriyaBros.md) for Goriya Bros strategies.

After you get seed satchel, take the warp back to boss key. After you have boss key, save and quit warp to the dungeon entrance. Now make your way to Aquamentus.

If you didn't save bombs for Aquamentus, your only options are to punch him to death or go buy more bombs, both of which are really slow.

###### Protip
Keep an eye on your ember seed and bomb count. You'll need one or both of these items to continue after D1.  There are some bushes in D1 that you can burn to get ember seeds if you need them.


## To Subrosia, then D2

Before making your way to subrosia, make sure you have at least 6 ember seeds and 1 bomb. You will need ember seeds to burn the sapling in town and bushes in the way of the Subrosia Portal, and you will need the bomb to hit the crystal to get access to Winter.

Make your way to the Eastern Forest as usual and do Rosa Hide and Seek. Go through the portal and go straight to the Temple of Seasons. Get the rod and go to winter. Use the bomb to hit the crystal, get winter, and leave Subrosia.

Make your way to the shovel. If you have no bombs at this point, you will need to dig for a bomb drop for D2.

Make your way to D2. At the entrance to D2 there are two patches of grass that give ember seeds. Grab them if you need them.

## D2: Snake's Remains
This dungeon is pretty much the same as any%, except of course you don't use sword.

## To D3
The route to Poison Moth Lair is the same as in any%

## D3: Poison Moth Lair
This dungeon is the same as any% up until Oumai.

### Miniboss: Oumai
Oumai isn't difficult to kill without sword. It's just slow. When one of the Oumai begin to pop up, drop a bomb at your feet, wait for a moment, pick up the Oumai, then drop it on the bomb. Continue this until you win. It will take at least 6 bombs.
