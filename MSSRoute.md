# Minimal Sword Slashes Route
---
## Before Dungeon 1
The run starts typically. Skip through the text for the roadies as fast as possible, dance with Din, skip through Onox cutscene, and make your way to D0 for the L-1 Sword.

This is where the run diverges. After you get the sword, go up above D0 and slash the grass (our first sword slash), fall down the hole and collect 30 rupees. Use 20 of these rupees to buy bombs at the shop. Go to the Maku Tree and slash your sword to open the path (2nd slash). Use a bomb to wake the Maku Tree, saving a sword slash, and get the key to D1. On your way to D1, use bombs to clear the two patches of grass in your way, saving sword slashes.

## Dungeon 1
Upon entering Dungeon 1, you are faced with two rooms with 4 stalfos in each. Ideally, you would use the 7 bombs you have left to kill them without using sword slashes, but that can be difficult. You would have to kill at least 2 stalfos with one bomb, and then kill at least 1 stalfos with each remaining bomb. (If a good manip is found later, it would definitely be paramount to consistently saving sword slashes in these rooms.)

There is a required sword slash to flip the minecart switch. Bombs, the only alternative you have at this point, won't flip the switch.

Damage boosting in the trap room before Goriya brothers isn't recommended unless you use a bomb to grab the fairy toward the end, but it would probably be best to save all of your bombs for Goriya Bros.

After you get seed satchel, take the warp back to boss key. (Save and Quit warping will require you to clear a stalfos room again, so don't do that.) After you have boss key, save and quit warp to the dungeon entrance.

Protip: Keep an eye on your ember seed and bomb count. You'll need one or both of these items to continue after D1.

If you are low on bombs after getting the boss key, you will want to go buy bombs so that you can kill the D1 boss with them. Exit the dungeon, burn the bush with the old man underneath to get 100 rupees if you need them, and go buy bombs. You need at least 5 bombs to beat the D1 boss.

## To Subrosia, then D2
The most important thing to remember on your way to getting the Rod of Seasons is to have enough ember seeds and bombs to clear the grass blocking the portal, and at least 1 bomb to get to winter without having to get the boomerang. Other than that this part of the run is identical to Any%. If you need ember seeds on your entry to D2, there are two grass tiles in front of the entrance that are guaranteed ember seed drops.
