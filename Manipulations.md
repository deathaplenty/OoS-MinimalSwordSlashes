  Octo X, where X is a direction, means the octo moves in that direction
  Impa, Right, Down = Maple spots

### Possible values that will get Fist Ring
- Octo down, autumn, octo down, winter, right, stand above stairs
- Octo right, spring, octo down, winter, Impa, stand near Impa snow piles
- need 4 rupees
