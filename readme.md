# About

This is a repo for notes on the Oracle of Seasons Minimal Sword Slash speedrun. Below is a set of rules for this category. In this repo you will find notes about where each required sword slash in the game lies, along with a proposed route to complete the game with as few sword slashes as possible.

# Rules
---
- A sword slash is defined as "pressing the assigned sword button and performing the slash animation."
- Spinslashes count as one sword slash, as one sword slash was necessary to perform it.
- Pokes count as one sword slash, as one sword slash was necessary to perform it.
- In RTA, all sword slashes count. The runner cannot reset to try to absolve himself of accidental or excessive sword slashes. (An example would be running out of bombs for D1 stalfos rooms, having to slash the sword, but then resetting to try to do stalfos rooms without sword slashes)
- The end goal is the same as any%, timing ends on the last hit of Dragon Onox.
