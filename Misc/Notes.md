# General Notes

## Dungeon 1
- Need to keep 5 bombs for Aquamentus and one for the Temple. Don't use them all on Goriya Bros.

## Enemies That Require Sword
- Medusa Head - Wear Dbl Edge Ring
- Magunesu - Wear Fist Ring
- Onox - Wear Red Ring

## Red Ring vs Dbl Edge Ring
  Red Ring is superior because it doesn't require a sword slash to get, the bonus damage applies to spinslashes, and you don't damage yourself.

## When to get Red Ring
 You definitely need it before Medusa Head because it can only be damaged by sword.


## Agunima
Can be damaged by bombs. Need at least 4 to kill him.

## Syger
Takes 4 bombs; hard to do.
Takes 8 Scent seeds; Easier to do. You can get two free hits at the start of the fight.


## Vire
Vire can be damaged with bombs. Good luck with that.
Vire takes 5 bombs to go to bat stage. If you have good timing, it only takes one more bomb to kill both bats when they swoop down.
6 bombs minimum, up to 4 mistakes

## Poe Sisters
Can be killed with scent seeds or bombs. Bombs are actually harder to use. Camp a single fire with bombs and ember seed slingshot.

## Red Ring Routing After D5
After D5 is the earliest any Red Ring stuff should be done. You have all 4 seasons at your disposal at this point and can kill the golden beasts at any time. You don't need Red Ring until D7 or D8.

### Golden Moblin
Can be killed after D5

### Golden Lynel
Can be killed on the way to D6

### Golden Octo
Can be killed before D3. Ricky can body the octo pretty hard.

### Golden Darknut
Can be killed before D7

### Earliest obtainable time
Before D7
