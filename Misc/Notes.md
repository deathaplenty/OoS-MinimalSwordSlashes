# General Notes

## Dungeon 1
- Need to keep 5 bombs for Aquamentus and one for the Temple. Don't use them all on Goriya Bros.

## Enemies That Require Sword
- Medusa Head - Wear Dbl Edge Ring
- Magunesu - Wear Fist Ring
- Onox - Wear Red Ring

## Red Ring vs Dbl Edge Ring
  Red Ring is superior because it doesn't require a sword slash to get, the bonus damage applies to spinslashes, and you don't damage yourself.
