# Medusa Head
This boss can only be damaged with sword, so Red Ring must be used to minimize sword slashes. It takes 8 spinslashes to kill her without any power modification. With Red Ring, the number of spinslashes needed is halved to 4. With Dbl. Edge Ring and using regular slashes, it takes 5 slashes instead of 8, but 1 slash and a manipulation is needed for the ring. Therefor, Red Ring is the current strategy to reduce sword slashes for this boss.


## Strategy
Use sword and cape on this boss. Charge spinslashes and run the boss into a corner, and use the cape to dodge attacks. It's very easy to miss a slash on this boss, so be extra careful.
